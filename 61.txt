Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to influence every aspect of our lives, not least the way pro-
duction is organised. AI, as a technology platform, can automate tasks previously performed
by labour or create new tasks and activities in which humans can be productively employed.
Recent technological change has been biased towards automation, with insufficient focus
on creating new tasks where labour can be productively employed. The consequences of
this choice have been stagnating labour demand, declining labour share in national income,
rising inequality and lowering productivity growth. The current tendency is to develop AI in
the direction of further automation, but this might mean missing out on the promise of the
ârightâ kind of AI, with better economic and social outcomes.
